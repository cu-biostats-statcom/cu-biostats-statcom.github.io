STATCOM is a community outreach program provided to New York City by graduate students in the Department of Biostatistics at Mailman School of Public Health. We offer professional statistical con-sulting, free of charge, to non-profit community and local governmental groups in the areas of data or-ganization, analysis, and interpretation. Through participation students benefit by gaining hand on experience while providing service to our local community.
