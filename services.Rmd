STATCOM is able to assist in areas of study design, analysis, and interpretation of results; however we do not have the resources to assist in data collection or entry. Some examples of our services are: **survey/sample design and analysis, graphical and statistical summaries, interpretation of survey results, and development of statistical models**.

No, all work done by STATCOM is free of charge.
