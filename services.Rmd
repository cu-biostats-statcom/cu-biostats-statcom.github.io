#### **Frequently Asked Questions:**

**Who does STATCOM serve**  
STATCOM serves government and non-profit organizations. The clients we work with generally do not have the funds available to hire a professional consultant, but are interested in using data to make more informed decisions about their operations. We generally do not accept projects that are from for-profit entities.
