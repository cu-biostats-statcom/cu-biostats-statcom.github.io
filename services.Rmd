## **Our Services**

STATCOM is able to assist in areas of study design, analysis, and interpretation of results; however we do not have the resources to assist in data collection or entry. Some examples of our services are: **survey/sample design and analysis, graphical and statistical summaries, interpretation of survey results, and development of statistical models**.

#### **Frequently Asked Questions:**

**Who does STATCOM serve?**  
STATCOM serves government and non-profit organizations. The clients we work with generally do not have the funds available to hire a professional consultant, but are interested in using data to make more informed decisions. We generally do not accept projects that are from for-profit entities.    

**Do clients pay STATCOM for their services?**  
No, all work done by STATCOM is free of charge.    

**Who volunteers for STATCOM projects?**  
Our volunteers are mainly graduate students (masters and doctorate). Faculty are not directly involved in our projects; however, we have a faculty advisor who will provide leadership, assistance with client meetings, and statistical consulting advice if needed.
